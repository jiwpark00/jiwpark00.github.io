### Interests
With biology/medicine, I am broadly interested in human genetics, particularly for complex diseases/traits. I was formally trained as a molecular biologist with expertise in neuroscience and protein biochemistry. Moving on from elucidating mechanisms of one gene, I currently employ large genetic screens and genome editing technology, such as CRISPR, to dissect the effects of multiple genes against a treatment.

With computational side, I am very interested in machine learning, data visualizations, app development, and human psychology. I am greatly interested in understanding how the advancements in machine learning/artificial intelligence can be coupled with centuries of psychology work on human mind, and whether these coupling can enhance our understanding of many problems in the society. In particular, I am interested in developing tools for better delivering the concepts, so data visualizations and app development have been involved in my training for computational side.

### Background
I am currently in 5th year of PhD program in Molecular Cell Biology at Washington University in St. Louis. My thesis work is currently under the mentoring of Dr. Tim R. Peterson in Division of Bone and Mineral Diseases, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine. Previously, my earlier part of graduate school work was under Dr. Jeffrey Milbrandt in Department of Genetics at Wash U. I also have rotated with other principal investigators in neurobiology and cardiology/metabolomics.

### Ongoing Project
I have been working on developing a web platform called MORPHEOME (Molecular ORphan PHEnOtype MatchEr). MORPHEOME aims to identify relevant orphan genes to queries, which can be disease, a gene, a drug, or a combination of the mentioned. My work classifies a human/mouse gene as an orphan gene if it is not characterized well as indicated by a low number of Pubmed citations about the gene.
